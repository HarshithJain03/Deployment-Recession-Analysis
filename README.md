![recession](https://c1.wallpaperflare.com/preview/634/496/50/refugees-economic-migrants-financial-equalization-help.jpg)


## Introduction 
This project aims to analyze historical economic data to predict recessions using machine learning techniques. By leveraging various algorithms and statistical methods, we've developed a model that can forecast economic downturns with reasonable accuracy. Additionally, we've deployed this model for easy access and visualization.

### Description

- **GDP (Gross Domestic Product)**: The total monetary value of all goods and services produced within a country's borders in a specific time period, usually annually or quarterly. [Source: IMF]

- **Unemployment Rate**: The percentage of the labor force that is unemployed and actively seeking employment. It's a key indicator of economic health, reflecting the balance between job supply and demand. [Source: Economic Times]

- **Inflation Rate**: The rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services is rising, leading to a decrease in purchasing power over time. High inflation can erode the value of money. [Source: Forbes]

- **GDP Growth**: The percentage increase in GDP from one period to another. It indicates the pace at which the economy is expanding or contracting. [Source: IMF]

- **Exchange Rate**: The value of one currency in relation to another. It determines the purchasing power of a currency in international trade. [Source: Economic Times]

- **Forex Reserves (Foreign Exchange Reserves)**: The foreign currency deposits and bonds held by central banks and monetary authorities. They serve as a buffer to stabilize the domestic currency and ensure liquidity in the foreign exchange market. [Source: IMF]
